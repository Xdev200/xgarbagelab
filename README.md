<h2>It is a great honor for us to introduce ourself. As you have already started to read, it won't take much time. So you must be thinking from where this name "XGARBAGELAB" came into light. Before, it takes much time of yours, let's come to the reality. As we lived almost for 2 years in a garage during our college days. We thought and mapped our idea and transformed it into a workplace. So we just derived the name XGARBAGE LAB from there and as you know X belongs to everyone. We are on a mission and we want to achieve that with a vision which lays down the path perfectly to reach there. We are a small unit of developers working smartly to achieve what we actually aim for.</h2>
